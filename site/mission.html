        <p>We founded <b>Hundred Rabbits</b> with the goal of building an audience that could sponsor the creation of high-quality free & open-source content.</p>
        <p>The combined revenue of <a href='http://patreon.com/100' class='external' target='_blank'>Patreon</a>, and <a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io' class='external' target='_blank'>Itch</a>, along with our minimal lifestyle, allows us to invest increasingly more time to the creation of original projects such as <a href='http://grimgrains.com' class='external' target='_blank'>Grimgrains</a> and <a href='http://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca' class='external' target='_blank'>Orca</a>. We also allocate time to contribute, document and help maintaining the open-source projects of others.</p>
        <p><a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid' class='external' target='_blank'>Dotgrid</a>, like <a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Left' class='external' target='_blank'>Left</a>, was originally created to be used internally, but has now grown into something used by thousands of creators. The development of the application was done with its source code available publicly which allowed for a <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed' target='_blank' class='external'>conversation</a> to occur between us and other Dotgrid users, seeing how differently each person used the tool revealed new directions toward which the tool could grow.</p>
        <p>Our intermittent internet connection makes for unpredictable release patterns, and spotty technical support, but allowing users to fix their own issues, encouraged people to learn, help each other to find solutions, and submit revisions for everyone to enjoy.</p><img src='../media/content/mission/002.jpg' loading='lazy' />
        
        <h2 id='energy_usage'>energy usage</h2>
        <p>The energy required to power tools like Xcode and Photoshop keeps growing, and the large and incessant updates have often long stopped adding worthwhile improvements. While fashionable devices and protocols exacerbate planned obsolescence, bloated software increase energy usage and shorten the lifespan of computers resulting in more than 130'000 computers ending in the garbage annually.</p>
        <p>We have decided to focus on documenting, and archiving, means of reusing and repairing older devices and programs. All of our tools are designed to work offline first, operate with little-power on older devices and operating systems. Operating this way, we can keep creating content while off-grid, and when our power and connectivity is limited.</p><q>Go slow, and fix things.</q>
        <p>We developed these tools out of necessity, because <a href='tools_ecosystem.html' target='_self' class='local'>our situation required it</a>, but it grew into something bigger.</p>
