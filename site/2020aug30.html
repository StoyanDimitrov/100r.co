<h2>News</h2>

<p>On August 11th, we stepped onto land after 65 days on the water ­— it felt amazing. We're walking everyday, and going out on long bike rides to build up some leg muscle again. We finished transcribing the <a href='https://100r.co/site/north_pacific_logbook.html' target="_blank">North Pacific logbook</a>, re-counting the 51-day trip from Japan to Canada — be warned, some passages in the logbook might be distressing to some people.</p>

<p>We released a video of the last month we spent in Minamiise, called <a href='https://youtu.be/7scwI_-zcBI' target="_blank">Our last days in Mie</a>. A video of our 2 weeks in Shimoda and of our North Pacific crossing will follow.</p>

<p>As a studio our main issues are internet scarcity, power management, data storage as well as hardware and software failures. Overtime we found ways to balance work, pleasure and maintenance. Rekka wrote an <a href='https://www.noonsite.com/report/insights-floating-studio-working-on-board-efficiently/' target="_blank">article for Noonsite</a> outlining these problems, and offering solutions.</p>
