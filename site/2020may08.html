Both of us collaborated to create <a href='https://youtu.be/FOyQU0oRvs8' target="_blank">Catpot</a>, a little cooking game. One of the entries, a remake of Kojima's P.T., was featured on <a href='https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/13/21219585/pt-remake-hypercard-game-jam' target="_blank">Polygon</a>. We also started migrating our repos to sourcehut, a service which aligns better with our projects.</p>
