<h2>News</h2>

<p>This month, <a href='https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/1232219254654521344' target="_blank">we returned to Japan</a>! We're happy to report that Pino is doing really well, no big damages to report. Our plan is to fix up our beloved, to get it ready to start cruising again. We wrote a post about what we did to prepare Pino for our 6-month absence called <a href='https://100r.co/site/typhoons_and_mold.html' target="_blank">Typhoons, mold and bugs</a>.</p>

<p>Devine was interviewed by <a href='https://futureofcoding.org/' target="_blank">Future of Coding</a>, and the podcast was released as two separate episodes. In the first, Devine talks about <a href='https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/044'>creating your own tools</a>, and the second is about Orca.</p>

<p>In other news, years ago Devine wrote music for the game <a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/511540/MoonQuest/' target="_blank">Moonquest</a>, and we're happy to say the game is out! You can listen/download to the soundtrack <a href='https://aliceffekt.bandcamp.com/album/noon-guest' target="_blank">here. Enjoy!</p>
